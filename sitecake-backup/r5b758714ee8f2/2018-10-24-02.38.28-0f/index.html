            <h1>Fall</h1>
            <p>It
            is the season of beautiful colors, cooler weather, corn mazes,
            festivals, candied apples, and falling leaves. For some, it is their
            favorite time of year. There seems to be that brief balance of not
            to hot and not to cold. I started thinking about the falling leaves
            and harvest time and how it could we could relate. Fall is
            considered a time of harvest. A time to reap from the hard work of
            the summer. There are moments in our lives, that we get to reap from
            our hard labor in the fields of the Lord. “And let us not be weary
            in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.”
            Galatians 6:9 And just as the trees shed their leaves, sometimes God
            allows us to shed a few burdens. Perhaps its time for a season change
            in our lives. The leaves of the tree die and fall but the tree lives
            on. It may not look like much for a while but it will blossom again
            with new life and new fruit. We usually think of death as a sad thing
            or as the end of something, but the bible says “Precious in the
            sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” Psalm 116:15 Just
            as the trees leaves die and fall to the earth from which they came,
            God’s people die and fall into the arms of Jesus from which they
            came. They get to return to their creator and rest in the arms of
            Jesus and enjoy the forever beauty of heaven. Just think about how
            much more beautiful the colors must be up there. “But as it is
            written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
            the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that
            love him.” 1 Corinthians 2:9 Maybe you are at a season change in
            your life. Maybe God wants to shed a few leaves and sustain you until
            he gives you new leaves and new fruit. Just remember if you are a
            child of God, you will someday get to fall into the arms of Jesus and
            be forever at peace with the Lord and Savior who made you.
            <br>“To
            every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the
            heaven:” (Ecclesiastes 3:1)

            <h1> Tiny House Festival </h1>
            <p>We recently attended the Decatur Tiny House Festival. The drive there was a little crazy with all the Atlanta traffic but we enjoyed out little mini vacation with our family. We were able to view over twenty tiny homes. Each one was very unique and customize to the owners needs. We saw campers and buses converted into homes as well as custom built tiny homes on wheels. Each home had a different feel. Some were very tiny, about 16 feet long, and some where more spacious with all the amenities you would need or want. The experience further solidified our desire to follow through with God’s plan for us to live simpler and freer. We are finalizing our designs now and getting ready to start purchasing the materials for the build. We have been so blessed with family and friends who have already helped in this process and are planning to help with the build. God provides. </p>
