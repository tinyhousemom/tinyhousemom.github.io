            <h1> Halloween? </h1>
            <p>
                Along with fall comes a very well known
                holiday. It has many names, Hallows Eve, Halloween, and All Saints
                Day just to name a few. There are many traditions that we are born
                into without much thought of why we celebrate or participate in them.
                Many times we participate simply because everyone else does. Sometimes we may know the original meaning or purpose and choose to
                alter details to suite our beliefs or wants. For our family, we want
                to be informed on what we are teaching our son and how what we are
                participating in lines up with God's word. Sometimes it seems that
                we care more about what is in our child's food, medicine, and
                environment than what is going into their growing minds. We are
                instructed to … “be ye separate, saith the Lord...”
                (2 Corinthians 6:17) We are not to conform to the practices of this world. The origin of
                Halloween starts with Celtic pagan rituals and beliefs. It's
                original name was Samhain, a time that the Celts believed the
                dead/spirits came and dwelled among the living. Some
                of the rituals included burning fires to help the dead make their
                way, various sacrifices through bonfires (crops, animals, and likely
                human), practices of divination, disguising themselves with costumes
                to blend in or hide from the spirits, and going house to house
                dressed as the spirits asking for food. If the household did not
                offer food it was thought to bring them misfortune from the spirits.
                Faces carved in pumpkins were meant to represent the heads of the
                spirits. Does any of this sound like it is biblical to you? Instead
                of standing up against these practices the early Catholic church
                attempted to christianize the practices and thus the name was
                changed. Why would a church have any business dealing in such
                practices that clearly go against every core truth of God's word? As
                time went on the practices remained the same in the church and in the
                pagan world as well. To this day participants in this holiday dress
                up in disguises and go door to door asking for a treat in order to
                avoid that house being tricked for not providing what is asked for. Children are allowed to dress as witches, vampires, devils, ghosts,
                and other evil influences. It is said to all be in good fun and
                innocent entertainment. Christians are still trying to christianize
                it by changing the name and making the activities seem less evil. What are you celebrating? “And
                have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
                reprove them.” (Ephesians 5:11) Satan is the father of deception. He has been disguising himself from
                the very beginning in the garden of Eden as he displayed the first
                trick or treat game on Adam and Eve. He hasn't changed. He wants
                our children's minds to be molded from birth to accept in the evil
                things that are said to be in good fun. He starts with television
                shows that show witches and vampires as cute and funny so that
                children become accustom and the stepping stones to more and more
                evil become easier and easier. For me Halloween is one of the many
                tools that the devil uses against families to blur the line of good
                and evil. He wants evil to be viewed as good. He doesn't want us to
                know the truth. He wants us to just follow in the steps of the
                generations that have continued to participate in evil practices
                unawares and unconcerned. There is a spiritual war going on whether
                you realize it or not. “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
                against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
                against spiritual wickedness in high places.” (Ephesians
                6:12) We need to make a decision of whom we are serving. “No
                man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else
                he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot
                serve God and mammon.” (Matthew 6:24) I don't know about you, “...but as
                for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.” (Joshua 24:15) Church we need to stand up and stand apart. “And
                be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing
                of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,
                and perfect, will of God.” I would like to encourage you to do some research on your beliefs and
                use the Holy Word of God as your main source of truth. (John 14:6)
                <br>
                “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.” (1 Corinthians 10:21)

            <h1>Fall</h1>
            <p>
                It is the season of beautiful colors, cooler weather, corn mazes, festivals, candied apples, and falling leaves. For some, it is their favorite time of year. There seems to be that brief balance of not to hot and not to cold. I started thinking about the falling leaves and harvest time and how it could we could relate. Fall is considered a time of harvest. A time to reap from the hard work of the summer. There are moments in our lives, that we get to reap from our hard labor in the fields of the Lord. “And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.” Galatians 6:9 And just as the trees shed their leaves, sometimes God allows us to shed a few burdens. Perhaps its time for a season change in our lives. The leaves of the tree die and fall but the tree lives on. It may not look like much for a while but it will blossom again with new life and new fruit. We usually think of death as a sad thing or as the end of something, but the bible says “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” Psalm 116:15 Just as the trees leaves die and fall to the earth from which they came, God’s people die and fall into the arms of Jesus from which they came. They get to return to their creator and rest in the arms of Jesus and enjoy the forever beauty of heaven. Just think about how much more beautiful the colors must be up there. “But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” 1 Corinthians 2:9 Maybe you are at a season change in your life. Maybe God wants to shed a few leaves and sustain you until he gives you new leaves and new fruit. Just remember if you are a child of God, you will someday get to fall into the arms of Jesus and be forever at peace with the Lord and Savior who made you.
                <br>
                “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:” (Ecclesiastes 3:1)

            <h1> Tiny House Festival </h1>
            <p>We recently attended the Decatur Tiny House Festival. The drive there was a little crazy with all the Atlanta traffic but we enjoyed out little mini vacation with our family. We were able to view over twenty tiny homes. Each one was very unique and customize to the owners needs. We saw campers and buses converted into homes as well as custom built tiny homes on wheels. Each home had a different feel. Some were very tiny, about 16 feet long, and some where more spacious with all the amenities you would need or want. The experience further solidified our desire to follow through with God’s plan for us to live simpler and freer. We are finalizing our designs now and getting ready to start purchasing the materials for the build. We have been so blessed with family and friends who have already helped in this process and are planning to help with the build. God provides. </p>
