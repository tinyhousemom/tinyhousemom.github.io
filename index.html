                <h1>My Nemesis</h1>
                <p>Let me introduce you to my arch nemesis, Stuff.  He is sometimes called clutter or junk.  He likes to creep into our homes and take over and cause chaos and discouragement.  He is disguised as gifts, heirlooms, and what we think are needs.  He wants to bind you up and keep you bondage inside your home in a constant battle that will usually end in defeat.  You may have a few wins and feel like you are getting ahead and then another holiday will happen and you have just as much coming in as you just got rid of and the cycle begins again.  Although this may not be as much of a battle for some, it has been my battle for way to long and I no longer want to be in bondage to our stuff. Why do we have so much stuff?  Where does it come from?  We are a greedy society.  We never have enough.  We get the biggest and best and then another bigger and better comes out so we need that too.  We have holidays and birthdays and we think the way to show love is to see how much we can buy someone.  We inherit or are given family heirlooms that we simply can’t get rid of because they were our great great grandmother’s.  We all seem to blur the lines of need and want.  <strong><em>“And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.” 1Timothy 6:8</em></strong>  Are we content?  Is having what we need and being taken care of enough.  God said he will never leave us or forsake us.  He is not slack concerning his promises.  Do we need anything else?  I have always been taken care of.  I may have wanted better or thought I needed more but I have always had food, shelter, and clothes to wear.  <strong><em>“Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have:  for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.” Hebrews 13:5-6</em></strong>  We serve a God who owns everything and who made everything.  He holds us in His hand.  Don’t you think He is going to take care of our needs?   He not only takes care of our needs but He blesses us with so much more even when we don’t deserve or appreciate it.  I will share more about the specific reasons that we collect and keep stuff in the upcoming posts.  I would like to encourage you to take a look around and take inventory of the lack of contentment we all struggle with in our lives.  What could you live without?  Is your stuff holding you bondage and keeping you from the life of contentment God has for you?  Is it stealing your time?  Is it stealing your peace?  Maybe your arch nemesis is the same as mine.  Maybe you feel defeated by all the clutter around you.  We serve a mighty God and nothing is to big for Him.  Lets fight this battle together and know that God will lead us to victory if we only trust Him and let Him show us His way and His will for our lives. Lets lift one another up in prayer.  There is power in prayer.  Thanks for reading.  God Bless! </p>

                <h1>The Son Shine</h1>
                <p> The Lord led me to start getting up early and going for a walk/jog in the mornings and spend time with Him.  It is such a blessing to spend time in His creation and enjoy its beauty each morning.  There is much that can be learned by observing God’s handy work.  One morning as I walked along the driveway and came to the end where the trees stop and the view of the sky opens up, I looked over to see the sunrise.  I usually see the beautiful rays peaking over the mountain as the sun slowly gets higher and higher. This morning I got up a little late so the sun was already fully risen.  As I looked over, I looked at the sun and then looked back to my path and I could still see those spots.  As kids our parents tell us not to look directly at the sun but we all try it at some point and we see those lingering spots. It changes our vision immediately.  I then thought about how the SUN relates to the SON, Jesus.  I don’t think it is just coincidence that the sun in the sky and the Son of God sound the same.  Once you see the Son, it changes your vision and your see those spots of Him everywhere you look.  The difference is that the spots we see when we look up at the sunrise eventually fade but when we see the Son of God, our vision is changed for all eternity.  Every where we look we see things differently.  Our eyes are opened and His light shines on our lives and we cannot put that light out.  His Holy Spirit then becomes our guide and if we are obedient, His light will shine through us to light the path for others to come to know that light.  When others look at us they should see that light. That light will shine in the darkness of this world.  The light of Jesus is the only way to heal the spiritual blindness that fogs our vision of God’s plan for our lives.     </p>
                <p> “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” (John 8:12 KJV)  </p>

                <h1>Where We Are</h1>
                <p>I have had several questions about our home and I just wanted to share where we are at in our journey.  In 2017 we focused on paying off debt and selling our house while purging our possessions along the way.    Although we have gotten rid of a lot already, we are still in the purging process.  Whenever we have free time we go through boxes and see if there is anything we will need and donate the rest. We had our 10x30 trailer built in August.  My husband is working on the design of our house and we are close to finishing that part of it.  He has build a few scaled models of it so that we can picture how the layout will work.  We hope to finalize the design this month and then start compiling the materials over the next few months and start building.  Our goal is to have our home finished by the first of the year. God has been our help and guide all along this journey and I will continue to share how he has led and provided in my upcoming blogs.</p>

                <h1>Why Tiny?</h1>
                <h2>(Part 2)  Stay-at-home Mom</h2>
                <p>Another important aspect of our lives that we felt would benefit by going tiny is our time with family.  The most obvious result of having a smaller living space is less time cleaning which leads to more free time.  What would you do with a little extra time?  Most tiny homes take a maximum of 30 min to clean the entire house. With more financial freedom and the downsizing of space, it allows me to stay at home with my son full time with much less strain on our budget.  I know many of you who have children, choose to work, but for me I knew I needed to stay home with my son.  I could not send my child somewhere and let someone else raise him for 8+ hours of the day.  I feel that God gave him to me and He will equip me with the skills I need to raise and teach him right.  With that being said, we live in a two income society, where the cost of living sometimes doesn’t allow a mother/wife to stay home. I do understand that and I know God knows and takes care of those in that situation just the same.  I knew that if God led me to stay home with my son, that he would provide a way and He has.  Sometimes we don’t know how He does it but He always provides.  In this time of the modern feminist movement, it is considered old fashioned to say that a woman's place is at home taking care of her family.  It wasn’t God who led people to live above their means and continuously desire more and more resulting in an imbalance of income and spending. That imbalance reduces the time the average Mother/Wife gets to spend with her family.  I would rather give up the so called comforts of this world and gain more priceless time with my family. I would like to encourage you to search the scriptures for how a woman is intended to live. I will leave you the verses that I came across while preparing this blog: </p>
                <p> "3-The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 4-That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 5-To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."   (Titus 2:3-5 KJV)  </p>

                <h1>Why Tiny?</h1>
                <h2>(Part 1)</h2>
                <p> While we have had many family and friends supporting us on this decision, many others have looked at us with skepticism and doubt. To some it is too extreme and impossible to be happy in a tiny house. The most often ask questions have to do with our son and how we will raise a family in a tiny space. There are many reasons that led up to the decision to go tiny. I will try to elaborate on a few in the next few blogs. The first reason I will start to explain is financial. In a country where bigger is always better, going tiny is rarely understood. Americans want more. Bigger houses, bigger food, more things, bigger events,... We never seem to be satisfied. There is always room for improvement when it comes to our possessions and our homes. To say we are living above our means is an understatement. My husband and I started out in a very small studio apartment and worked our way up each time until we ended up “owning” our own home. So many of us think, if we only had more space we would be happier... More space equals more money whether it be rent or mortgage. We are all raised that debt is a normal part of life. That everyone has it and that there is no way around it. Society tells us we should “own” our own home and have the nicest cars and go on the nicest trips we can't afford. Do you really own something that you haven't paid for yet? Do you own something that someone else has given you the money to pay for? Do you own it or the lender? We were convicted about being subject to the lender by the verse in Proverbs 22:7. “The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.” I don't want to be servant to anyone but Christ. We started by paying off all credit cards, our car and finally selling our house. Being debt free is an amazing feeling. Knowing that you owe no man and that they aren't controlling your financial decisions anymore is priceless. It doesn't mean there aren't still struggles, but there is freedom from financial bondage. We are praying to stay debt free through this process.There is a way to live within your means. Our journey would not happen without God's help. We are amazed each day at how he provides even when we are doubtful. </p>
                <p>"The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender." (Proverbs 22:7)</p>

                <h1>Why Blog?</h1>
                <p>My husband and I started discussing the idea of starting a blog to share and document our Tiny House Journey.  I felt that it would allow me to record the process as well as share it with others.  As I contemplated the idea, the question started running through my mind of whether anyone would find what I have to say of any interest or help.  As I shared my thoughts with a friend the doubt quickly disappeared and I knew that I needed to write about God's wonderful grace in our lives. Without Him we would have nothing. We don't deserve any of the blessings He has given us yet He continues to bless. We hope to inspire others to take the step to break free of society's definition of home as we share what God has shown us and give Him Glory for all He has done for us.  God has blessed us all with so much and yet we as a society continue to want more and more.  Think for a few minutes about all the space in your home and how much of it you actually use on a daily basis. Our family has been led to be rid of the bondage of "stuff" and allow ourselves more time to focus on what is truly important.  We want to share our journey with you and be obedient to what God has called us to do.  We pray that something you read will inspire or bless you in some way.  Stay tuned as we share what led up to this commitment.  May God Bless you! </p>
