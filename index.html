                <h2>Why Tiny? Part 1</h2>
                <p>
                    While we have had many family and
friends supporting us on this decision, many others have looked at us
with skepticism and doubt. To some it is too extreme and impossible
to be happy in a tiny house. The most often ask questions have to do
with our son and how we will raise a family in a tiny space. There
are many reasons that led up to the decision to go tiny. I will try
to elaborate on a few in the next few blogs. The first reason I will
start to explain is financial. In a country where bigger is always
better, going tiny is rarely understood. Americans want more. Bigger
houses, bigger food, more things, bigger events,... We never seem to
be satisfied. There is always room for improvement when it comes to
our possessions and our homes. To say we are living above our means
is an understatement. My husband and I started out in a very small
studio apartment and worked our way up each time until we ended up
“owning” our own home. So many of us think, if we only had more
space we would be happier... More space equals more money whether it
be rent or mortgage. We are all raised that debt is a normal part of
life. That everyone has it and that there is no way around it. Society tells us we should “own” our own home and have the nicest
cars and go on the nicest trips we can't afford. Do you really own
something that you haven't paid for yet? Do you own something that
someone else has given you the money to pay for? Do you own it or the
lender? We were convicted about being subject to the lender by the
verse in Proverbs 22:7. “The rich ruleth over the poor, and the
borrower is servant to the lender.” I don't want to be servant to
anyone but Christ. We started by paying off all credit cards, our car
and finally selling our house. Being debt free is an amazing
feeling. Knowing that you owe no man and that they aren't
controlling your financial decisions anymore is priceless. It
doesn't mean there aren't still struggles, but there is freedom from
financial bondage. We are praying to stay debt free through this
process.There is a way to live within your means. Our journey would
not happen without God's help. We are amazed each day at how he
provides even when we are doubtful.

                <h2>Why Blog?</h2>
                <p>My husband and I started discussing the idea of starting a blog to share and document our Tiny House Journey.  I felt that it would allow me to record the process as well as share it with others.  As I contemplated the idea, the question started running through my mind of whether anyone would find what I have to say of any interest or help.  As I shared my thoughts with a friend the doubt quickly disappeared and I knew that I needed to write about God's wonderful grace in our lives. Without Him we would have nothing. We don't deserve any of the blessings He has given us yet He continues to bless. We hope to inspire others to take the step to break free of society's definition of home as we share what God has shown us and give Him Glory for all He has done for us.  God has blessed us all with so much and yet we as a society continue to want more and more.  Think for a few minutes about all the space in your home and how much of it you actually use on a daily basis. Our family has been led to be rid of the bondage of "stuff" and allow ourselves more time to focus on what is truly important.  We want to share our journey with you and be obedient to what God has called us to do.  We pray that something you read will inspire or bless you in some way.  Stay tuned as we share what led up to this commitment.  May God Bless you!</p>
