                <h2>Why Blog?</h2>
                <p>My husband and I started discussing the idea of starting a blog to share and document our Tiny House Journey.  I felt that it would allow me to record the process as well as share it with others.  As I contemplated the idea, the question started running through my mind of whether anyone would find what I have to say of any interest or help.  As I shared my thoughts with a friend the doubt quickly disappeared and I knew that I needed to write about God's wonderful grace in our lives. Without Him we would have nothing. We don't deserve any of the blessings He has given us yet He continues to bless. We hope to inspire others to take the step to break free of society's definition of home as we share what God has shown us and give Him Glory for all He has done for us.  God has blessed us all with so much and yet we as a society continue to want more and more.  Think for a few minutes about all the space in your home and how much of it you actually use on a daily basis. Our family has been led to be rid of the bondage of "stuff" and allow ourselves more time to focus on what is truly important.  We want to share our journey with you and be obedient to what God has called us to do.  We pray that something you read will inspire or bless you in some way.  Stay tuned as we share what led up to this commitment.  May God Bless you!</p>
